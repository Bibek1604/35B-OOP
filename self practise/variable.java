// In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

// String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
// int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
// float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
// char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
// boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
    
// Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
// Names must begin with a letter
// Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
// Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
// Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
// Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names




//JAVA DATATYPE

// Primitive Data Types


// Data Type	Size	Description
// byte	1 byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
// short	2 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
// int	4 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
// long	8 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
// float	4 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
// double	8 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
// boolean	1 bit	Stores true or false values
// char	2 bytes	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values


// Non-Primitive Data Types
// Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

// The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

// Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
// Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
// A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
// A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
